# About me

---

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Marchello2m 
I had been with my previous employer for 10 years. In this time I have learned skills that will serve me well in the current career path as well. 
I consider myself a loyal and punctual employee.
I have learned that you are responsible for your work, therefore I treat all the tasks given to me with utmost importance. 
I try to do them in the set time frame and I pay attention to the quality of my work. 
Working with clients has tought me to be patient and given me the skills to come to an agreement with people on what would be the result they would want to gain from my services. 
After 10 years in the property management field I have decided to change my career path and I have decided to dedicate my further career to the IT field. 
My choice fell to programming since I like to solve problems and I like to create new things. 
Programming has shown me how I can develop new programms and how to customize existing code to suit other purposes.
